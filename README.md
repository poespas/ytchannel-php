PHP code to handle a Youtube Channel

How to use this api?
First of all, you need to include the Api to your page, by using this code:
```
include_once('ytApi.php');
```

Then you can get the channel array with this code:
```
channel('https://www.youtube.com/user/YouTube');
```
Or:
```
channel('YouTube');
```

Good luck!
